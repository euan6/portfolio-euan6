                <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <p>Creating webpages and working with HTML, CSS and Javascript accounts for a large amount of my experience
                with coding. It was what I was originally taught back in high school, starting from the very basics
                of creating a skeleton structure to using DOM and XHR to build dynamic sites and even PHP for some backend.
                Found below is a few of my projects on github which show off my skills (Click to be taken to the repository).</p>

                    <h1>PHP Backend Project</h1>
                    <p>This was one of my very first big projects which came in my final year of high school.
                    What i created was a review website which used PHP and SQL to query a database to show
                    content of my webpage. There was a login and logout system which functioned correctly
                    and once a user was logged in, only then could they view the contents of the pages.
                    There were a few pages which were interactive including a read, search and add review pages
                    which let the user either view all the reviews in the database, search for a specific one
                    (rating, description, name) or write and submit a review themselves.</p>

                    <h1>Web Programming Project</h1>
                    <p>This web programming project was part of my coursework in my 2nd year at university.
                    The main goal of the project was not to make it fancy but actually to increase my knowledge
                    of git and version control. I experimented with branches, merging and github pages which have all
                    been very useful. The website does however showcase a lot more JavaScript, using a lot of functions,
                    event listeners, XHR and DOM. These are mainly used to reduce the amount of duplicate HTMl by creating
                    a layout in JavaScript then loading the data onto the page using XHR and event listeners.</p>
